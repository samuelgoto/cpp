This is a series of studies of new C++ features to help me catch up with the lastest developments of the language.

It starts with some [warming up](#srchello) and syntactical sugar, but then goes deeper into destructors, operator overloading and move semantics.

Ultimately, I implement [unique_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr) in userland to convince myself that there isn't any magic going on in the compiler.
